# DHIS2 Hacktoberfest
Welcome to DHIS2 [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/). A month dedicated to helping out open source projects by submitting Pull Requests (PR's) to open source projects that participate.

DHIS2 also participates in Hacktoberfest with several repositories, and all of these are listed below. 

## Tickets
Because DHIS2 typically has tickets in JIRA, we're using this Hacktoberfest repository to put all these tickets together. All tickets have links in them to the original JIRA ticket, and a link to the relevant repository, which in turn is also marked for Hacktoberfest using a `topic` as required by the rules.

## Repositories
The following DHIS2 repositories are participating this year:
